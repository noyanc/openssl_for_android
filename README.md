# openssl_for_android
If you have a warning message on the Google Play console about possible removal of your app because of the vulnerable openssl version, you can use this recompiled one for openssl 1.0.2g

1.0.2g version is compiled with;
- C++99 (of084 folder)
- C++11 (of092 folder)

I also keep the old 1.0.1j version under a seperate folder for whom needs to recompile something with it.

I mainly compiled and tested these openssl libraries under openFrameworks.
Anyway, anybody who need it can use it.
