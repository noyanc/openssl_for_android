# openssl_for_android
If you have a warning message in the Google Play console about possible removal of your app because of the vulnerable openssl version, you can use this recompiled one for openssl 1.0.1j

I mainly compiled and tested this version under openFrameworks 0.8.0.
Anyway, anybody who need it can use it.
